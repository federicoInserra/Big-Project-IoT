# 2nd Delivery

## Comments

In the first delivery of the project we received several comments:

The most important of all was that we were not brave enough in our project, choosing the simplest and in some ways less creative way.
This was the comment that pushed us the most and for this reason we decided to completely change our idea and start from scratch with a totally new and in our opinion more innovative and engaging idea.
We decided to completely change our idea and not continue with the previous one because, even talking about it with our designer Elisa, we didn't find convincing solutions that would have allowed us to bring the IoT to the center while keeping the original idea. Moreover, we liked the new idea much more than the previous one and we were enthusiastic about it from the beginning, also the designer loved the idea and give us other suggestions to improve it.


The second comment was about the presentation of the idea, we were too fast and unclear in presenting it, also the slides were too dense and had few images.
In order to solve these criticalities we decided to better prepare the presentation of the idea by focusing much more on the basic concepts and explaining them in the best way and by creating slides as clear and smooth as possible.

The third comment was about the centrality of the IoT in our project, the board was quite unnecessary and almost all the work was focused on the smartphone.
That's why we completely changed the architecture of the project to make the board central and make everything rotate around it.


## Changes
As said in the comments section, we have totally transformed our project, starting from a completely new idea.
That's why each section has been completely modified to follow the new idea.

### Design

The first change concerns the target of our project. Before, the target group was mainly teenagers and young adults, who were more used to using different smartphone apps. Now instead the project foresees a greater involvement of all users visiting the museum, thanks to the use of different physical objects and visual interaction with the statue.

The initial problem has also changed, now we have focused on the fact that the statues were originally coloured and not white as we see them now. This is a fact that not many people know and that could allow people to learn something new about the works in the museum.

The last change is related to the user experience. 
In particular, this has gone from the simple passive experience of using an app to answer questions, to a much more active experience. 
Now the user moves actively in the space to look for the right objects to associate to the statues and to be able to see the hologram representing the statue with the original colors.

### Architecture

The architecture has also changed radically, so as to guarantee an almost total centrality of the IoT.
Before, the board simply sent a bluetooth signal to the user's smartphone to indicate the location inside the museum.
Now the user must use the object (equipped with nfc) to interact with the board.

When the board recognizes the right object by NFC code, it shows on screen the image of the corresponding statue, then the hologram is generated thanks to a prism placed above the screen.
In addition, every time the board detects an NFC signal it sends it to AWS cloud, where all interactions are recorded on a database and then displayed by a dashboard accessible by the museum curators.
The curators can use the available data to understand which statues users interact with most often and which are the most common mistakes made.


### Evaluation

As far as evaluation is concerned, in the previous delivery we used a questionnaire to assess whether or not people would like our idea.
This time we decided to test our idea by making users interact directly with it.

We put the users in front of our structure explaining briefly how it works and its purpose, and then we watched them perform their task.
We also asked them to tell us their every thought and difficulty they encountered during the experience in order to identify critical issues and remove them.

Using this method, we have a more concrete idea of how users interact with our infrastructure and what they think about our idea, giving them the opportunity to express themselves by speaking freely instead of answering a questionnaire.



## Brief presentation of the technical work done since the 1st delivery.

- Set up the cloud infrastructure on AWS
- Write the MbedOS code for the NFC module
- Write the MbedOS code for the Wi-Fi module
- Set up the MQTT communication between the board and the cloud
- Write the code to display the image on the screen
- Build the structure to show the hologram
- Create an image of a coloured statue


## A brief list of the functionality that is still missing and will be done till the 3rd and final delivery.
- Set up the DB to maintain the statistics about the statues interaction
- Create an Accessible dashboard to display this data to the museum curators
- Tests with functioning system and users

## Brief presentation of the evaluation conducted since the 1st delivery.
- Calculation of the costs of the simulation
- Calculation of the costs of the real system
- Calculation of the image latency of the system (Time from NFC signal to hologram)
- Interviews with users

## A brief list of what you aspect to evaluate till the 3rd and final delivery.
- Test the entire system with real users
- Calculation of the cloud latency of the system (Time to send data to the cloud and show them in the dashboard)
- Improve the latency of the image.
