# Design

This project intends to produce an interactive activity for the visitor. The idea originates from an interest in the original aspect of statues. So we introduce a reconstruction of the marble colorized and shown through a hologram.

## Scenario 1

Mario is going to spend his weekend with his son Enrico but doesn't want to stay at home all the time. He wants to build a great relationship with his son and wants to surprise him with something new that he has never seen before. Enrico is in his last year at primary school and is studying the Roman Emperor. His father wants to take him to the museum to make him passionate about ancient Roman. He knows that a museum could be dull for a little boy. Mario will look for a place that can be fun and futuristic for his son (and even for himself). He finds out that in the Sapienza museum there are new technologies that show the true colors of the statues. He thinks it's a good idea to go there.

## Scenario 2

Melinda has spent her last six months in Rome and is enthusiastic about how much culture one place can contain. She is two weeks away from leaving and wants to spend every minute that she has left exploring this beautiful city. She spends a lot of time inside the Città Universitaria, and tomorrow she will meet her friend Julio there. She knows that inside the Città Universitaria there is the Museo dell' Arte classica but she never had the opportunity to visit it. When she enters the museum with Julio, Melinda finds out that the museum is different from any other museum she has visited in Rome. Inside there is a hologram that reproduces the statue with the original colors! At this point, Melinda has to share this exciting news on her Instagram account and many people tell her that they didn't know that statues were originally colored.
