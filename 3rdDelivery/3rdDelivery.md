# 3rd Delivery

## Comments

During the second delivery, we received positive comments related to the project idea and the use of IoT, and we were very pleased considering that we had started from scratch with a new idea.

The main criticisms we received were:

- The fact that it didn't make much sense that the hologram wasn't always visible but that it needed user interaction to make it appear.
  Also, the interactions using the objects were a bit forced.

- The evaluation document was incomplete, did not follow the previous document, and did not accurately describe how to do experiments with users.

First comment:
We decided to insert the interaction because, in the preliminary interviews with users, it had emerged that they would have preferred to play by choosing the right object for the statue instead of passively looking at the hologram.
However, we decided to investigate even deeper and experiment with users to see if they preferred to interact or not and how they prefer to interact.
All the tests we have done are described in the evaluation document.

The experiment results told us that most users would prefer to interact with the statues using the objects.
Some of them prefer to use an app.
Almost none of the tested users would like to see the hologram passively.

Second comment:
In this case, we decided to try to have more continuity between the documents and above all to be more careful in explaining the experiments done with the users.

## Changes

After the second delivery, we made minor changes to the project, since it was already mostly developed. We added some features and improved some technical aspects.

## Design

We decided to change the second persona under the advice of the Designer, Elisa. The scenario in which Melinda is involved was modified to be adjusted to the new requirements.

## Architecture

The architecture was stable but during the implementation of the new functionalities, we decided to change some aspects to make the communication between the parts easier. We started working with a NoSQL database because we wanted to save files in a JSON format but while building the dashboard, we found out that with an SQL database queries were more accurate.

## Evaluation

The evaluation was expanded with a user based evaluation that we conducted. We defined some new KPI's and we have made a study of the possible alternatives to realize our idea (for example vr and projectors).
We added a new image of a statue to our repository.

## Brief presentation of the technical work done since the 2nd delivery

Since the 2nd delivery we implemented the following features:

- Set up the SQL database
- Created an S3 bucket to store images
- Created a script to download the image if isn't in the main memory and that shows the image
- Created a dashboard to inform curators about the frequency of activation of a statue
- Lambda function to save MQTT messages inside the Database
- Updated the code of the board to MbedOS 6.1
- Updated Python AWS IoT SDK to v2

## Brief presentation of the evaluation conducted since the 2nd delivery

- Study of the possible alternatives to realize our idea
- Think aloud evaluation
- Possibility to implement an application instead of using objects
- The latency of the image with a new library

## A brief list of the functionality that is still missing and that we did not manage to evaluate.

- The interaction with real objects because of the NFC sensor on the board was limited and didn't allow us to use tags to write on it.
- The integrated screen of the board. In our Proof of concept we used a replacement because the board in our possession didn't have a built-in screen.
- We didn't add as many images as we wanted because there are few images available online
