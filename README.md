- [Leonardo Razovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-razovic-4b20b1121/)

With the help of [Elisa L'Angiocola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisa-l-angiocola-57a69353)

## The Idea

The aim of this project is to add more interactivity to the museum in order to involve visitors more during the visit and to allow the museum curators to get useful information about the most interesting rooms.



The idea is to create a system that through the NFC activates the display of the board and an hologram comes out with a colorized statue. The interaction of users with the statue could be useful for museum curators to valuate the engagement os a certain statue. 
This data will be displayed on a dashboard accessible through an URL.

The board uses the MQTT protocol to communicate with the cloud infrastructure and when receives the data it will show the image of the hologram.
