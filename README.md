## The Idea (prima Bozza)
The idea of this project is to make a museum more valuable by adding a new user experience. This experience includes a quiz that is about Casts that are displayed in each room of the museum. In each room the application shows a different question about some sculpture and for each right answer the player gains some points. This project is developed with beacons and Google Cloud platform.
