Alice is miserable because she has to study for her final exam in high school, for which she has to craft a sculpture. If she fails the exam, she has to repeat her final year of high school. The sculpture she has to craft is a classical statue. After the sculpting, she needs to do an oral exam to explain why she chose that cast and the story of it. She should go to the museum to search for some inspiration, but she always gets bored in museums. Alice finds out that, inside the Sapienza museum, she can play a new game that will test her knowledge of classical art. She goes there and starts exploring while playing the game. When she answers, the App gives a brief explanation of the sculpture. Once she leaves the museum, she discovered inspiration and learned something new.
