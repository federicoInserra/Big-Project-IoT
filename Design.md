The idea of NomeApp is to create a valuable experience for young museum visitors. Teenagers are usually less engaged during a visit inside a museum, so we focused on creating an app that will entertain them. The app is an interactive quiz. Every time a person enters a room, the application exposes a question about some art pieces of the room. If the answer is correct the player gains some points. After the solution, the player will get a brief explanation of the question so he/she can learn more about a specific sculpture. When the visit is over, players can confront their scores and see who is the highest in the final rank. 
## Personas
