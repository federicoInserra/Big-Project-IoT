# NOMEAPP
## Idea
The idea of NomeApp is to create a valuable experience for young visitors to the museum. Since teenagers are usually less engaged during a visit inside a museum, we've focused on creating an app that will entertain them. The app is an interactive quiz, every time a person enters inside a room, the application shows a question about some statues inside the room. If the answer is correct you gain some points. After the answer, the player will get a brief explanation of the question so he/she can learn more about a specific sculpture. 
## Personas 
Gabriele, Rome 17 y.o: Gabriele is the best student in his class, he is smart and loves to study. He attends lectures at the Liceo Classico and even if he doesn't like classical history he loves to get all the attention. Gabriele is very competitive and wants to demonstrate to his professor that he studied for this museum visit. He is usually a calm person but when the competition is on nothing can stop him. Gabriele usually visits from 3 to 6 museums per year, usually with the school.

Alice, Rome 18 y.o: Alice doesn't like to study very much, she is a student at the Liceo Artistico in Rome and gets very bored every time she gets inside a museum, indeed she visits at most two museums per year. Her final project for the exam is a sculpture project and she has to do some researches and decides to go to the museum. She is interested in learning something new but in a funny way because traditional methods of learning don't work for her. 
## Scenario 1
Gabriele visits the museum with the school and starts to play when he gets inside the museum. His final goal is to be the first of his class and wants to get all the answers right so he spends extra time in each room to understand the most he can for each statue. In the end, he looks at his score, and once again, he got everything right so he can exit the museum with satisfaction.
## Scenario 2
Alice is unhappy because she has to study for her final exam in high and she has to craft a sculpture. If she fails the exam she has to repeat her final year of high school. the statue she has to craft is a classical statue and she also needs to do an oral exam to explain why she chose that statue and the story of the statue. She should go to the museum to seek some inspiration but she always gets bored from museums. Alice finds out that inside the Sapienza museum she will find a new game that will test her on her knowledge of classical art. She gets inside and starts looking at sculptures meanwhile she plays the game. When she answers the game give a brief explanation about the sculpture. When Alice exits the museum she found the inspiration for the exam and learned something about classical art.
